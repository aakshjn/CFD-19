# Problem 

Election security involves the protection of election processes and critical voting infrastructure from cyber attacks. Elements in need of protection include: registration databases, voting machines, other systems to manage the election, and systems that report & display results.
Some election security methods rely on time-consuming manual processes like manual verification of the documents, manual booth-voting

The 5 most vulnerable problems are: 

Informationwarfare

Electronic voter registration databases

Voting machinery and tabulation systems

Election reporting systems

Post-election audits

From a cybersecurity perspective, every part of the election process that involves some type of electronic device or software (especially if connected to the internet) is vulnerable to hacking.
# Solution

The data has to be secured and to be made non-eraseable.

Using Azure's blockchain to develop an Ethereum blockchain-based voting platform.
The technology can further be extended to a web-app, hardware based and a mobile-app to increase the users' ease of access to voting.

Users to be first identified using Azure's custom-vision based identifier(webcam based), along with their fingerprints over their unique voter IDs.

Users can use their unique voter ID to open the virtual ballot box, check, cast and verify their vote is present and correct.

The custom generated ballots contain unique tokens in the form of QR codes to prevent the same ballot from being scanned twice.

All votes are public and traceable using an append-only decentralized blockchain made via appending the virtual-ballots.
